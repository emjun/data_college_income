# Dataset about College Income

I am presenting with you a real data analysis task. The research question you need to answer is “What factors influence the income recent college graduates earn?”. 
Using any of the materials available, guide me through the process of how you would go about answering the research question. Feel free to write, draw, or do anything else to communicate effectively.  

Again, to remind you, this is not a hypothetical question. This is a real question and your process should reflect what you would do with this real data.
